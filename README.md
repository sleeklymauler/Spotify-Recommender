# Spotify-Recommender

A python script that accesses the Spotify API to recommend songs based on inputs of other songs and artists. Made when I was in 10th grade for the [IB Personal Project](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/middle-years-programme/assessment-and-exams/personal-project/).

## Set Up

Clone the repo. In order for the program to access the Spotify API, you'll need to create an application on [the Spotify developer website](https://developers.spotify.com/). Copy and paste your app's client_id and client_secret in the tokens.env file. You'll also need to install dependencies.

### Dependencies
* [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)
* [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)


## Usage

Run ```python PersonalProjectLukeS.py```
